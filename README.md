## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have NVM installed to manage your current version of Node and NPM:

```
brew install nvm
```

Once NVM has been installed, navigate to the project's root directory and run:

```
nvm install
nvm use
```

Now install all of the project's dependencies via NPM:

```
npm install
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. Hot reloading is set up to pull in changes whenever code is modified.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
